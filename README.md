 *Khushi's Recipe*

Indian style flavourful & delicious *masala pasta* is my favourite! Today I'm gonna to teach you that only. This simple & quick pasta is super easy to make & just needs 25 mins. It is kids' friendly & can be packed even in lunch box or served as an after school snack. It also makes for a quick dinner for your entire family.
